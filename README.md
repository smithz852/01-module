# Module 01

## Description

I have taken the pre-existing website for Horiseon and added accessibility feature to the HTML code. This includes descriptive alt text for all images and an updated website title. Additionaly, the CSS code has been consolidated to avoid redundancy, and the HTML code has been updated to properly reflect these consolidations whole functioning proprely. CSS comments were also added for further clarification.

## Usage

The deployed website can be accessed via the below link:
https://smithz852.github.io/01-module/

GitHub Repo Link:
https://github.com/smithz852/01-module.git

The website displays all information on one page. The links at the top right of the page within the header can be used to quickly jump to their respective content section further down the page. 

For access to HTML code from the webpage, please right click on the webpage itself, and use the "Inspect" option. This will immediatly direct you to the HTML code within the elements tab. For CSS code and comments, please navigate to the "Sources" tab within "Inspect", which will allow you to navigate to the style.css folder where the desired information is located. This info can also be viewed on the repo itself.

Below is a picture of the webpage:
